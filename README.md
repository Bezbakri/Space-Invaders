# A Space Invaders clone in Python

Use your arrow keys (or the 'A' and 'D' keys) to move, and Spacebar to shoot. Try to get the highest score possible (it does get saved), and don't get hit!

## setup

Just clone the repository, make sure you have pygame installed, and run ``python game.py`` in your terminal.
